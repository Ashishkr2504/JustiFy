Law cannot turn a blind eye to such situations, nor can it decline to give adequate response to the necessities arising therefrom.7 The Supreme Court in Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli8 recommended to the Union of India to seriously consider bringing an amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to incorporate irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce. 2.2 The irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground for divorce by itself. But while scrutinizing the evidence on record to determine whether the grounds on which divorce is sought are made out, the circumstances can be taken into consideration. No divorce can be granted on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage if the party seeking divorce on this ground is himself or herself at fault. The decree of divorce on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down can be granted in those cases where both the parties have levelled such allegations against each other that the marriage appears to be practically dead and the parties cannot live together. The power of the Court to grant divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be exercised with 7 Supra note 1, pages 292 293. 8 Supra note 2. 13 much care and caution in exceptional circumstances only in the interest of both the parties.9 2.3 In Geeta Mullick v.

In the case of such a separation the essential purposes of marriage have been frustrated, and its further continuance is in general not merely useless but mischievous. 93.

The marriage has all the external appearances of marriage, but none in reality. As is often put pithily, the marriage is merely a shell out of which the substance is gone. In such circumstances, it is stated, there is hardly any utility in maintaining the marriage as a facade, when the emotional and other bonds which are of the essence of marriage have disappeared. 94.

It enables the State governments to appoint one or more Marriage Officers for its purposes for various administrative units. The Act does not apply in the State of Jammu and Kashmir but provides for the appointment of Marriage Officers there for the people domiciled outside but living within the State (Section 3). The procedure for civil marriages under this Act is more or less the same as under the first Special Marriage Act of 1872 beginning with a notice of an intended marriage to be given in the prescribed form to the Marriage Officer of the district in which at least one party has lived for at least 30 days (Section 5) and ending with its solemnization in his presence (Sections 11-12). The provision of the old Act of 1872 for a Marriage Certificate Book to be maintained by the Marriage Officers is retained in the new Act which also provides that the marriage certificate shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence of the fact that a marriage under this Act has been solemnized and all formalities respecting the signatures of witnesses have been complied with.

Like the latter, all these local Acts also clarify that the presence of a State-appointed Mohammedan Marriage Registrar will not be obligatory for any marriage, and also that neither non-registration would affect the validity of any marriage nor will mere registration validate a marriage which is otherwise invalid under Muslim 20 law. Registration under these Acts is thus a mere facility provided by law. All the Mohammedan Registrars licensed under these Acts have to function under the general superintendence of District Registrars functioning under the Registration Act 1908 and are required to transmit to them their registration records every month. The Inspector-General of Registration functioning in the State under that Act has to exercise control on all Mohammedan Marriage Registrars and issue regulations for their guidance. All these Acts empower the State Government to make Rules for carrying out their purposes, and such Rules have been made and amended from time to time. Under the Rules framed under the Bengal law of 1876 a Permanent Committee headed by the Inspector-General of Registrar oversees appointments, suspension and removal of Mohammedan Registrars.
